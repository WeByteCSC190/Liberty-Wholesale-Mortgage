                <h4 className="legal_text_h4">Why you need a privacy policy</h4>
                <p> Privacy is not a new concept. Humans have always desired privacy in their social as well as private lives. But the idea of privacy as a human right is a relatively modern phenomenon.
                    Around the world, laws and regulations have been developed for the protection of data related to government, education, health, children, consumers, financial institutions, etc.
                    This data is critical to the person it belongs to.
                    From credit card numbers and social security numbers to email addresses and phone numbers,
                    our sensitive, personally identifiable information is important.
                    This sort of information in unreliable hands can potentially have far-reaching consequences.
                    Companies or websites that handle customer information are
                    required to publish their Privacy Policies on their business websites.
                    If you own a website, web app, mobile app or desktop app that collects or processes user data,
                    you most certainly will have to post a Privacy Policy on your website (or give in-app access to the full Privacy Policy agreement).
                    There are several reasons for a website to post its Privacy Policy agreement on its website.</p>
                <p> Here are some of the main reasons: </p>
                <p>  Required by the law</p>
                <p> Required by third party services</p>
                <p> Increases Transparency</p>
                <p>Let's take a look at each of these reasons in more depth.</p>
                <p> Your access to and use of the Service is also conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with the
                    Privacy Policy of the Company. Our Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection,
                    use and disclosure of Your personal information when You use the Application or the Website and tells You
                    about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You. Please read Our Privacy Policy carefully before
                    using Our Service.</p>
